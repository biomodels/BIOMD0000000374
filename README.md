**Abstract:**   
S. Bordin and colleagues have proposed that the depolarizing effects of
acetylcholine and other muscarinic agonists on pancreatic beta-cells are
mediated by a calcium release-activated current (CRAC). We support this
hypothesis with additional data, and present a theoretical model which
accounts for most known data on muscarinic effects. Additional phenomena, such
as the biphasic responses of beta-cells to changes in glucose concentration
and the depolarizing effects of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase
pump poison thapsigargin, are also accounted for by our model. The ability of
this single hypothesis, that CRAC is present in beta-cells, to explain so many
phenomena motivates a more complete characterization of this current.
